## What Is It?

A simple library for submitting simple jobs & DAGs on the Bristol machines.

Designed to allow easy setting up of jobs and deployment on worker node, without the user worrying too much about writing custom scripts, or copying across files to HDFS.

Note that this probably won't work for more custom or complicated workflows, but may be a useful starting point.
